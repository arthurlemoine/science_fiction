## Question 1

I clearly uploaded everything before reading but no worries it's fixed. 

## Question 2

Link to github: https://github.com/arthurlemoine/science_fiction.git

## Question 3

```{r}
planets <- vroom(here("data", "PLANETS.csv"))
planets$`Radius (Earth)` <- as.numeric(planets$`Radius (Earth)`)
planets$mass <- as.numeric(planets$mass)

head_df <- planets %>%
  head(n=10)

knitr::kable(head_df, digits = 0)
```

This dataset is made of `r nrow(planets)` planets described by `r ncol(planets)` variables. 
BONUS: a nice table of the 10 first rows. 

## Question 4

```{r}
# Create a summary table
summary_table <- data.frame(
  Number_of_Observations = nrow(planets),
  Number_of_Variables = ncol(planets),
  Number_of_Missing_Values = sapply(planets, function(x) sum(x == "_")),
  Observations_with_Missing_Values = sum(apply(planets, 1, function(x) any(x == "_")))
)

# Print the table
knitr::kable(summary_table, format = "markdown")
```
